Detection of abnormal activities in Surveillance Videos suing Deep Learning Techniques.
Human Anomalous Detection In Surveillance Videos is a deep learning (Machine Learning)
project aimed at detecting abnormal behavior in video footage. To recognize and classify human 
activities, the system makes use of deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs). The system is trained on large datasets of human activities and uses transfer learning to
adapt to new environments. Detection algorithms are then applied to determine if the behavior is
normal or not. The goal of the project is to develop a system that can accurately identify anomalous 
human activities, such as theft, violence, or medical emergencies, in a crowded environment. The 
system can be used for security and surveillance applications, as well as in health care and 
industrial settings. Preprocessing the video data, training the CNNs, and merging the models are 
all steps in the implementation process. On real-world datasets, the system has been analyzed and
tested, with positive results in terms of accuracy and speed. It offers a more complex and 
dependable way for spotting out-of-the-ordinary human activity, which has the potential to
significantly improve the capabilities of conventional security systems.
